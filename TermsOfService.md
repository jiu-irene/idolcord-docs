## Requirements for playing Idolcord

1) All Users must follow Discordâ€™s Terms of Service.
2) All Users must not be banned on the Idolcord Support Server.
3) All Users must follow the Rules of the Bot (see below).

## Rules of the Idolcord Bot

1) Only one account per person is allowed.
2) Be nice and considerate towards other users.
3) Do not repeatedly ping users without their permission and try using Discord IDs instead of mentions when using commands on other people.
4) Abusing the auction system for the sake of giving someone currency is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to re-selling a card to the original seller after the auction ends or placing bids without the intention of winning an auction to drive the price higher.

## Miscellaneous

This includes, but is not limited to, adding or removing currency, cards or progress from any player or revoking access to the bot for certain individuals with good reason.
2) You are not entitled to any form of compensation when losing progress, cards or currency due to an issue with the bot, even though we will try our best to provide adequate compensation wherever possible. If something happens, you can contact us using the `/feedback` command or the `#help channel` on the Support Server.
3) If your account is inactive for over 90 days, certain cards in your inventory may be replaced at the discretion of the Staff.
